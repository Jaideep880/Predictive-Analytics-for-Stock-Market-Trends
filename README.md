Predictive Analytics for Stock Market Trends
Description
This repository provides code and implementation for predicting stock market trends using Predictive Analytics techniques. By combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Time-Series Analysis, this project leverages the following machine learning models to forecast market movements:

Stacked LSTM
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Naïve Bayes
Linear Support Vector Machine
Non-Linear Support Vector Machine
Methodology
NLP with Historical News Data
We use NLP techniques to analyze historical news data for sentiment and its impact on stock trends. The following algorithms are implemented:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Naïve Bayes
Linear and Non-Linear Support Vector Machines
Time-Series Analysis with Stock Data
For time-series analysis, we implement the Stacked LSTM model to predict future trends based on historical stock data, focusing on sequential dependencies.
